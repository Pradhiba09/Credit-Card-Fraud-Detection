# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Detects fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithm.


## Introduction  
Online transactions such as Google Pay, PayPal, and banking apps are highly convenient — but they also increase the risk of fraud.  
This project builds a fraud detection system using **Random Forest**, which can analyze large transaction datasets and distinguish between **legitimate and fraudulent** transactions.

## Methodology  
The workflow of this project includes:
1. **Data Collection** → Kaggle dataset  
2. **Data Preprocessing** → Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding  
3. **Resampling** → Balancing data using under-sampling and over-sampling  
4. **Model Training** → Training Random Forest classifier  
5. **Evaluation** → Using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
6. **Model Deployment (Future Scope)** → Deploying in real-time fraud detection systems

 ## Steps:
1. Split dataset into **train (70%)** and **test (30%)**
2. Train Random Forest Classifier
3. Evaluate using metrics below

 Accuracy - 98.3% 
 Precision - 96.8%
 Recall - 97.1% 
 F1-Score - 96.9%
